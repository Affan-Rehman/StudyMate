## Problem Statement
The lack of access to quality education in underserved areas is a significant concern. StudyMate seeks to bridge this gap by offering a web-based solution that caters to:

- Students in underserved areas with limited access to quality education.
- Teachers and educators who want to offer their courses online.
- Education policymakers and administrators.

## Gathering Requirements
To ensure our platform meets the diverse educational needs, we conducted the following activities:
- Surveys and interviews in under-served areas to understand specific educational needs and preferences (from friends).
- Collaboration with teachers and educators to identify courses and their requirements (from college).
- Consultation with education policymakers and administrators to ensure compliance with education standards.

## Web-Based Solution Features
